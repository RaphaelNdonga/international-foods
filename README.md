# [PROJECT LINK](https://raphaelndonga.github.io/international-foods/)

## Description
International-Foods is a decentralized application (dApp). It allows users to purchase food on the blockchain, as Non Fungible Tokens. The blockchain network is Celo.

It was inspired by Street-Kigali, a simple decentralized application that works the same. This project goes a step further by making the Foods sold "non fungible", through the ERC721 implementation.

The term 'NFFT' has been coined to mean Non Fungible-Food Token. This dApp allows users to create NFFTs, buy NFFTs, keep them, or approve them for sale.

## Usage
1. Install the [CeloExtensionWallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/celoextensionwallet/kkilomkmpmkbdnfelcpgckmpcaemjcdh?hl=en) from the google chrome store.
2. Create a wallet.
3. Go to [https://celo.org/developers/faucet](https://celo.org/developers/faucet) and get tokens for the alfajores testnet.
4. Switch to the alfajores testnet in the CeloExtensionWallet.
